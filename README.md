# Project1
 My first professional data science project

---

In this project I made a dashboard using a dash library in jupyter. In the code I made an EDA and, in addition, I made the functions and the construction of the entire dashboard in the same code file. As it was my first dashboard, I didn't pay much attention to good programming or organization techniques. This is just a test to know how to create a dashboard. If there is something that can be improved in the code, or even if there is an error in my Exploratory Analysis, there may be better in my Exploratory Analysis, thus improving.
